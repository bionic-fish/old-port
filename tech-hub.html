                    <p>A mock up for a company that provides technology services. When browsing websites for design inspiration,
                        a lot of the technical websites a quiet bland or plain. There purpose is quiet simple, provide a message, product
                        or service that the user can clearly identify with. Having a fondness for all things tech related, I thought it
                        would be a wonderful idea to attempt to replicate a modern and simplistic company website to dive deeper into web
                        development and its technologies.</p>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
    
                    <p>Attempting to replicate a standard business website that sells technology services, while keeping
                        the design simplistic and minimalistic. The main focus of a business' products or services page it to 
                        create a welcoming atmosphere in which a user feels comfortable with purchasing a product.
                    </p>
                <br>
                    <p>That gave me the idea to create a mock up technological based website with minimalistic design patterns,
                        front and center information for the user and a responsive layout for multiple devices. 
                    </p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
    
                <p>By using a coffee based color tone, I felt I captured the atmosphere
                and overtone colors of a cafe. This paired with the selective images
                that potray a similar vibe inside the cafes was a great mix of pre-selected images
                and color theory.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The design features a mobile view and a desktop view both with responsive elements
                    up until the screen dimensions of 3440x1440. Cafe menus and forms recieve a background
                    color and additional properties on desktop view.
                </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
    
                <p>An updated layout and remodel of a previous version of a cafe website. Developed using the latest
                    semantic tags in HTML5. Mixed with current layout methodologies utilizing CSS.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Taking use of the display flex property in CSS to layout specific content depending
                on a users viewing device. Mock up created as a personal project to develop greater proficency in
                programming web technology languages.

                <h3>Testing / Debugging</h3>
    
                <p>Testing takes place using multiple browsers to test compatibility. Lauching
                    on both a local server for development and testing purposes, and creating live
                sites on github to test features.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Multiple devices are also used for testing to ensure there are specific media query
                    breakpoints in place. This ensures a responsive design and layout across multiple browsers
                    and devices.

                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>Creating this website helped develop a better understanding of layout principals
                    through the use of CSS Flexbox techniques.<br>
                Provided an insight into color theory and principals. Dont over expand the color pallete,
                use a primary, secondary, tertiary and an accent color.
