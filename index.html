    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <br>

    <p>I am Christopher Harris, a self taught web developer and IT enthusiast.
      I began my interest in computers at an extremely young age and ever since
      have always been fascinated & intrigued with technology.

      <br>

      I believe in developing clean and efficient code bases, providing a mobile-first design mindset, but catering
      to desktop for more intricate design patterns and layouts. Coupled together with my love for learning new things,
      web development and design has becoming an amazing hobby, being able to create from scrath beautiful and responsive designs,
      concepts and mockups.</p>

      <h3>Travel Lite | Hotel Booking App Concept</h3>

      <br>

      <p>Developed a mockup for travel based web page that allows searching current
      location for best deals on hotels. Provides information about the selected
    hotel and the features, services and ammenities they supply. Developing this
  developed an interest in form creation and data manipulation when taking requests
  from users via test input and storing it on a server for later use.</p>

      <h3>Coffee Shop | Local Cafe Webpage</h3>

      <br>

      <p>As an avid coffee lover and enthusiast, I decided to create a mock up store
        page for a cafe. This included a contemporary designed landing page to entice users
      upon arrival, a sleek smooth scroll to the menu and about section. And a link to
    the application for pre ordering a coffee before reaching the store.</p>

      <h3>Photography Website | Grid Layout</h3>

      <br>

      <p>While learning various CSS techniques for positioning and layout, i became fascinated with
      grid! This is an amazing and indepth feature. Being able to give exact position, sizing and layout options
    was exceptional. Having learnt from creating a basic photography gallery showcase page, i was then able
    to implement a similar feature into my current portfolio.</p>

    <h3>Ice Cream Consortium | Ice Cream Flavours App Concept</h3>

    <br>

    <p>My love for ice cream provided a fun and interesting experience to create
    a web mock depicting different flavours of ice cream. This was a task I set upon
  myself to develop a greater understanding of layout capabilities of CSS. It also
helped enhance my understanding of how gradients work (blending multiple colours together),
and implementing them with a corresponding flavour colour combination.</p>

  <h3>PC Monitor - Product | Product Page</h3>

  <br>

  <p>Recreating a local tech companys product page for my monitor gave me insight on
  grid placement, floats, and current layout techniques to provide a hypothetical
  product page. Being able to display all current information about the product without
feeling too crowded will make for a welcoming and easy to navigate store page.</p>
