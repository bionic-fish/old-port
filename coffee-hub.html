            <p>A mock up design for a Melbourne based cafe. This personal project was created
            to develop an understanding of layout principals and displaying semantic markup
            effectively.
            </p>
        <br>
            <p>Developed to enhance current web technology programming skills, learn better placement via CSS, 
            and develop a better understand of color theory.
            </p>
        <br>
            <p>As a coffee lover and frequent visitor of local cafes, I thought it would be a great way 
            to combine two interests and create something with a dedicated theme in mind.
            As a personal project, this was one that I took a great interest in developing and designing.

            <h3>The Problem</h3>

                <p>Attempting to find a local coffee shops menu can be a hard task. Especially if the cafe
                doesnt have a website. Having to physically go into the cafe to see the prices before ordering
                became tedious, so I wanted to develop a way to view cafe prices with ease.</p>
            <br>
                <p>That gave me the idea to create a mock up cafe website with a ease of use navigation and 
                a coffee color coordinated design. 
                </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>By using a coffee based color tone, I felt I captured the atmosphere
            and overtone colors of a cafe. This paired with the selective images
            that potray a similar vibe inside the cafes was a great mix of pre-selected images
            and color theory.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The design features a mobile view and a desktop view both with responsive elements
                up until the screen dimensions of 3440x1440. Cafe menus and forms recieve a background
                color and additional properties on desktop view.

            <h3>Development</h3>

            <p>An updated layout and remodel of a previous version of a cafe website. Developed using the latest
                semantic tags in HTML5. Mixed with current layout methodologies utilizing CSS.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking use of the display flex property in CSS to layout specific content depending
            on a users viewing device. Mock up created as a personal project to develop greater proficency in
            programming web technology languages.

            <h3>Testing / Debugging</h3>

            <p>Testing takes place using multiple browsers to test compatibility. Lauching
                on both a local server for development and testing purposes, and creating live
            sites on github to test features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Multiple devices are also used for testing to ensure there are specific media query
                breakpoints in place. This ensures a responsive design and layout across multiple browsers
                and devices.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>Creating this website helped develop a better understanding of layout principals
                through the use of CSS Flexbox techniques.<br>
            Provided an insight into color theory and principals. Dont over expand the color pallete,
            use a primary, secondary, tertiary and an accent color.
