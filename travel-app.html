                <p>A mock up for a hotel booking website + application. As a fond traveller and 
                adventurer, it is always a blessing to have a hotel application that can find something to 
                suite ones aquired tastes. In using a variety of hotel booking applications, I decided I would create my
                own in order to expand my skill set in form creation and user input validation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Having a booking app that is responsive across multiple devices was a top priority. Some forms behave
                weird when viewed on a phone or screen smaller than 300px wide. Taking the inititive to build a fully responsive
                hotel booking form and gain extra knowledge about web based services.
                </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>

                <p>Viewing an array of forms on smaller devices can sometimes be a hassel if the form contains
                a lot of elements. To address this issue commonly found throughout hotel booking apps, I created a 
                responsive form that splits particular sections for easier viewing of the elements.
                </p>
            <br>
                <p>Another issue is some forms dont always save a users input after submit or a next page with can incur the user 
                to visit and resubmit the same form multiple times. This issue was addressed by attaching form validation to all elements
                that require a specific piece of information to be passed along to the server for reuse. E.g email and attached user name
                for login purposes.
                </p>

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>By replicating other hotel booking apps and applying my own flair to the final design, I have come up
                    with a sleek and professional looking hotel booking application that can be used when travelling abroad.
                The dark colored elements really help make the scenic photographs stand out as vibrant pieces of the webpage.
                By giving a light colored background, this also enhances the richness of the travel photographs in a pleasing way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The design features a mobile view and a desktop view both with responsive elements
                up until the screen dimensions of 3440x1440. Cafe menus and forms recieve a background
                color and additional properties on desktop view.

            <h3>Development</h3>

            <p>Created by researching and taking inspiration from other hotel design application and websites to develop
                a better understanding of development procedures attaining to web based technology. Developed the form validation
                using a mix of HTML5 input properties and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking use of the display flex property in CSS to layout specific content depending
            on a users viewing device. Mock up created as a personal project to develop greater proficency in
            programming web technology languages.

            <h3>Testing / Debugging</h3>

            <p>Testing takes place using multiple browsers to test compatibility. Lauching
                on both a local server for development and testing purposes, and creating live
            sites on github to test features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Multiple devices are also used for testing to ensure there are specific media query
                breakpoints in place. This ensures a responsive design and layout across multiple browsers
                and devices.

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>Creating this website helped develop a better understanding of layout principals
                through the use of CSS Flexbox techniques.<br>
            Provided an insight into image placement, design principals for UX / UI elements and form creation
            and validation.
