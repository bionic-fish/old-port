                    <p>A mock up design for a medical website and accommodating application.
                    This personal project was created to develop an understanding of JavaScript Modals to 
                    display the mock up application. And form validation via a sign up sheet.
                    Developed to enhance current web technology programming skills, further my current JavaScript
                    skillset and develop a better understanding of form validation.

                <br>
                    <p>This personal project was created for my younger sister who has type 2 Diabetes. I am hopeful
                    that with continious self learning I will be able to produce a working app that can monitor 
                    blood glucose levels in real time without the need for invasive techniques.

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
    
                    <p>Watching my younger sister take blood measurements of gluscose levels before almost every meal
                    made me want to develop an application. This application would suite all type 2 diabetics by running
                    the app through a smartwatch to monitor statistical values of blood glucose in real time.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>Wanting to eliminate the invasive procedure of having to prick ones finger and draw a sample of blood to 
                    measure if glucose levels are in the correct range. Also helping to monitor current ranges in real time
                    to prevent 
                    </p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
    
                    <p>Going for a sophisticated medical design view. I implemented the body with a dark colored background,
                    with a pervailant white for the information text. The dark green/grey background paired well with the 
                    medical images found of unsplash. Giving the medical website a professional look and similar feel across 
                    multiple pages.</p>
                <br>
                    
                <p>The design features a mobile view and a desktop view both with responsive elements
                    up until the screen dimensions of 3440x1440. feature menus & header elements
                    recieve additional properties on desktop view.
                </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
    
                <p>An updated layout and remodel of a previous version of a cafe website. Developed using the latest
                    semantic tags in HTML5. Mixed with current layout methodologies utilizing CSS.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Taking use of the display flex property in CSS to layout specific content depending
                on a users viewing device. Mock up created as a personal project to develop greater proficency in
                programming web technology languages.

                <h3>Testing / Debugging</h3>
    
                <p>Testing takes place using multiple browsers to test compatibility. Lauching
                    on both a local server for development and testing purposes, and creating live
                sites on github to test features.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Multiple devices are also used for testing to ensure there are specific media query
                    breakpoints in place. This ensures a responsive design and layout across multiple browsers
                    and devices.

                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>Creating this website helped develop a better understanding of layout principals
                    through the use of CSS Flexbox techniques.<br>
                Provided an insight into color theory and principals. Dont over expand the color pallete,
                use a primary, secondary, tertiary and an accent color.
                    color
