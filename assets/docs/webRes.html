  <h1>Digital Resume</h1>

    <h2>Mr  C . D . Harris</h2>

    <p>Procuring a job in the web development field or digital development & design.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="r-heading">Summary</h3>
      <p>My Name is Christopher Harris and I am an aspiring web developer and seeking employment in the field of
        information technology. PC's and related technologies, video games and digital media has always been a fascinating
         interest of mine since the youngest age. Problem solving and puzzel challenges have also been of great interest.
        Combined with my love for the latest tech trends, this gave me a steping stone into the world of
        programming and more specifically web development and design.
<br>
<br>
        I am currently seeking a position for a junior front end web development position or a development
        role in or around Melbourne, Victoria. While having no industry experience as a self taught programmer
        and now a current student I am inclinded to take on a casual or weekend based role in order to develop
        the skills necessary to work at industry level with a design & development team.
<br>
<br>
        If employed or put onto a trial run, I am hoping to have access to experienced developers or senior mentors who will
        be able to provide code reviews and discussions on best practices and industry standards. Just being envloved in
        the design or development of a small to mid sized company would be extremely beneficial to me as both a self taught
        enthusiast and student. Getting to learn about about industry practices such as latest tech stacks, version control,
        testing and debugging interfaces and modules.
